1. I would say that for functionality, I got a solid 3 because I got through all of that functionality.

1. OOP I would say 3 as well. My encrypt and decrypt methods are a little long, but everything else is really well structured and I think I followed single responsibility pretty well.

1. TDD I would say is a 3 or 4. I was really thorough with my testing. Covered everything according to SimpleCov. I implemented a few stubs as well.

1. Version Control I would say 3 or 4. I think I tracked everything well and never really had any problems throughout the project. Good commit messages and comments.
